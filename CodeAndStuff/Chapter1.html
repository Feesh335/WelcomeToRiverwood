				Overview
			</h2>
			<p>
				The party gathers together in Riverwood after hearing promises of riches and mysteries in the wake of the calamity. <a href="#">The mayor</a> of the town offers a fortune for the return of his <a href="#">missing daughter</a> while the <a href="#">Ordo Novis</a> offers rewards for information regarding the calamity and the fate of Meridan's Point. They are given a compass attuned to the essence of the <a href="#">mayor's daughter</a> and prodded to explore <a href="#">old town</a> for clues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon arriving in Old Town, the party is greeted by cultists pretending to be citizens, thieves, and treasure hunters. Points of interest include the mana tainted tavern, the mayor's former residence, and a curio shop. Investigating the mayor's former residence reveals that <a href="#">the daughter</a> was there recently and that the building is a hotspot for <a href="#">cultist</a> activity. The compass points East to Vellis.

					Sidequest: Arcane Ales
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The barkeeper can be found in the mana tainted tavern in old town. If talked to, he will explain how he wants to try making arcane infused drinks, but his ingredients were stolen by <a href="#">Slug</a>, the captain of a group of bandits from out of town. He offers free drinks and some coin for the return of his equipment, or the players can hold on to the ingredients and make their own brew (Takes a few days) but will give up on the monetary reward.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bribing or threatening any of the thieves in Old Town will get them to reveal that Slug is hiding in the windmill in Riverwood and that he is planning to make his own brew. Returning the ingredients will result in the players being given alcoholic mana potions and a moderate amount of coin.
					</li>
          <li>
            If talked to in general, the barkeeper will talk about what he remembers of the incident, how it's been good for business because of the rich mages and people spending thinking the world's about to end, and what Riverwood used to be like (Quiet backwoods with little to do but drink)
          </li>

					Encounters
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Riverwood itself is peaceful, but old town is home to cultists, novice mages from the Ordo Novis Outpost, thieves, and explorers. Cultists and mages are not initially hostile but will attack if they see someone aiding the other faction. Explorers are likely to have treasure they're willing to trade.
					</li>
          <li>
            Wolves and lesser arcane elementals can be found around the edge of town and may be randomly encountered on the path to Vellis. 
          </li>
					<li>
						Upon entering the mayor's former residence, the players will find <a href="#">a mysterious hooded figure</a> floating in the bedroom. The compass will go haywire and the figure will teleport away. The party will then encounter a group of cultists believing that the party was trying to attack "The Priestess". They will become friendly if the party convinces them they were paying homage or else they will attack.
          </li>
				</ul>

					Points of Interest
				</h3>
        <ul>
				<li>
					The players will start at the Ordo Novis Outpost where they will be given the necklace attuned to the essence of the mayor's daughter. Talking to them will reveal that they have a cartographer who will give the group the updated maps of <a href="#">Riverwood</a> and <a href="#">Southern Mollinstead.</a>
				</li>
        <li>
          The mayor's residence in Riverwood is where players will find <a href="#">the mayor</a> who will explain the disappearance of his daughter and how he's had to ally with the Ordo Novis in order to maintain order. Chatting with him will reveal how his daughter was a priestess who spent much of her time at Narlan's Priory and disapproved of his alliance with the Ordo Novis.
        </li>
        <li>
          The curio dealer in old town has maps, arcane enchanted goods, and beetles that will seek out arcane energy. The beetles can be used to bypass perception checks on finding arcane relics hidden throughout the campaign.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tavern in old town has arcane infused drinks, a bartender with a sidequests, and an uneasy peace between the cultists and mages. It wouldn't take much for a fight to break out between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The windmill is where the group of bandits led by Slug are hiding. They can be killed or negotiated with to retrieve ingredients for the bartender's sidequest.
        </li>
