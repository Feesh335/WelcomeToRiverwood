				Overview
			</h2>
			<p>
        After heading over from Oldtown, the players find the town is in chaos and get a message from the Ordo Novis to investiage Meridan's last know whereabouts in the Nere'Vei ruins. Exploring the ruins reveals that they have mostly been explored, and there is a large, ominous looking central chamber with an empty pedestal. Entering the room triggers arcane traps placed by <a href="#">Maureen the Magnificent</a> who is more interested in bragging and showing off than actually trying to fight. Once dealth with, an apprentice mage can be freed from stasis and will explain that Meridan found some sort of relic of unspeakable power a few minutes ago (two months ago, he was in stasis the whole time and unaware of this) and brought it back to Meridan's point.
        The Ordo Novis sends an envoy with loot to reward the players for this information and urge them to go to Meridan's point to investigate further.
