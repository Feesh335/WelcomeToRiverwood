				Overview
			</h2>
			<p>
				The party has decided that they like to live dangerously and have found their way into the Chittering Dark, an underground passage through the mountains infested with arcane infused chitterers and all other sorts of horrible cave critters. The party will encounter Guard Captain Arnsgrim and the dwarven outcasts he is defending from the insects. Arnsgrim will work with the party to find a way out of the caverns and do everything he can to kill every horrible little insect along the way. Arnsgrim will try to guide the players into killing the Chitterer Queen to end the infestation. The only exit from the caverns is through a tunnel left by the Collapsin' Bull Wyrm, but it won't let the group through without a fight, unless they can trick it into swallowing a barrel of TNT. A shop and (low quality) shelter are available in an area the dwarves have dug out. The Chittering Dark is mostly sheltered from the arcane fallout and does not cause arcane corruption.
