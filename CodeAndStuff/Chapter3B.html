				Overview
			</h2>
			<p>
				The party has decided on taking the long way around to Meridan's Point and sets off for Narlan's Priory and eventually Fort Cainhurst. Upon arriving in Narlan's Priory, the party will find that an anti-magic zone is covering the town to shield it from the arcane fallout and is being maintained in shifts by the Mundus Faithful in the church. However, a large concentration of arcane energy has been flowing down from Meridan's Point and has caused a rift to form in a nearby field. The rift keeps letting arcane elementals into the world and the town is currently under attack by them (monster sheets listed below). After killing the newly spawned elementals, the priory is afforded some peace and the party may talk with the townsfolk. Father Abernathy will have a side quest to fetch a powerful relic to summon a titan of Mundus to destroy the rift once and for all, while Sister Abernathy will tell the party the truth about Alanna if they can convince her they're trustworthy. The priory is in an anti-magic zone and does not cause arcane mutations while staying in it.
			</p>
      <p>
        After leaving the priory, the party makes their way towards Fort Cainhurst, a military training ground that was majorly damaged in the blast. Meridan kept many of his unearthed relics in the fort, including several unearthed runic binding stones which have caused many of the fort's residents to rise again as bound. Travelling north caused them to encounter the arc-giants and flee, while trying to head south made them feel faint from the lower concentrations of arcane energy, so they have found themselves stuck within the fort. Some of the less well preserved runestones have resulted in reanimated soldiers who have lost their sentience and only have animalistic instincts. The fort is inundated with arcane energy and corruption will apply quickly here.

					Sidequest: An Offering for Mundus
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						After saving the priory (for now), Father Narlan will ask the group if they can recover the emergency relic (a gem imbued with tons of arcane energy) so that a ritual to summon a titan of Mundus can be performed so it can destroy the rift once and for all. He will mention that a thief (Tim the Scoudrel) took off with the gem and several warding stones a few days ago. 
					</li>
          <li>
            After recovering the relic, the whole town will join in a ritual together and summon a titan of Mundus which destroys the rift and any arcane creatures that have spawned recently and will begin rampaging north. Following in the titan's wake will provide protection from the arcane fallout as well as a distraction from the corrupted elk as it makes it's way towards Meridan's Point. Father Narlan and some of the residents of the priory will also join the party during the finale of the campaign.

            Sidequest: A Scoundrel's Stash
          </h3>
          <li>
            I'll write the rest of this later, but basically Tim wants the loot being guarded by the runic abomination and will fight alongside the party and try to take off with the loot once it's under 1/4 health.

					Encounters
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The rift spawns waves of arcane elementals about once a day. These include force orbs (https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Force_Orb_(5e_Creature)), arcane shardlings (https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Radiant_Shardling_(5e_Creature)) (replace all radiant effects with force, no raise dead), and arcane slitherers (https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Steam_Slitherer_(5e_Creature)) (replace steam with arcane).
					</li>
          <li>
            Some of the Bound soldiers in Fort Cainhurst are hostile (see knight statsheet, apply Bound effects). The runic abomination is in a storage area under the fort.
          </li>
