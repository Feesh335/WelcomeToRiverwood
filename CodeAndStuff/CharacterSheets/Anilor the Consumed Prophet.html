					<p class="sample-text">
						The inseperable twin brother of Corlith, Anilor inherited the divine blood of both parents, granting him the full strength of the divine spark of magic.
            The divine blood caused him to hear the voices of his ancestors and receive visions of impending disasters. One day he received a vision of a series of 
            disasters stemming from the Mollinstead region and began gathering up a group of adventurers who became one of the first to arrive when the Ordo Novis 
            sent out their plea for help. Anilor and his party helped to evacuate many of the survivors in Vellis before continuing north through the Chittering Dark.
            While in the Chittering Dark, he began to have nightmares of a black seed falling from the sky and heard a voice telling him to stamp out the corruption before it 
            could spread. Unbeknownst to Anilor, this was not the divine spark, but the lies of Krimerus, the prince of the realm of Nightmares tricking him into an ambush. 
            After fighting through the caverns alongside Corlith, Anilor found that the seed from his visions was actually a meteorite with the essence of Krimerus within it
            and the two were consumed by his influence, becoming his avatar within Mollinstead. With his body and mind hollowed out, he has taken on a new identity as the 
            prince of worms.</p>
