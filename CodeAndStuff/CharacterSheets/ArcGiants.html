						The arc-giant phenomena was first discovered by Nere'Vei researchers investigating the landscape after a wild magic surge had forced a nearby leyline to rupture.
            The unstable energies had killed off the majority of a nearby swamp's wildlife, however, most of the plant life had survived and became large and warped. Many of the 
            smaller creatures within the swamp had begun to display similar patterns and began to grow out of control as well. After a few days, a particularly large mouse began
            to display more odd characteristicsm, its veins had begun to glow with arcane energy and it stopped seeking out food and water, instead spending its time basking
            in an one of the ruptures left by the leyline. Experiments were run on the mouse, and the researchers found that wounds inflicted on the mouse would cause a burst
            of energy to come forth, striking whoever made the incision. The wound would not heal on its own unless the mouse was exposed to arcane energy which quickly closed
            the wound.</p>
            <p> </p>

            <p>After a few weeks, the surviving wildlife in the area had grown incredibly large and the environment now favored whichever animal could control an area with a leyline
            rupture to bask in, allowing its wounds to heal and continue growing. While not outright aggressive, the affected animals became highly territorial towards anything they
            believed to be a threat to their energy source. Researchers found that the wildlife would attempt to steal any arcane curios from their bags and would generally leave them 
            alone afterwards.</p>
            
            <p>Months later, a new phenomena was noticed. Researchers had to use remote scrying tools to observe the area as the wildlife in the area had now become true giants and were 
            deemed too dangerous to observe up close. The wells of arcane energy from the leyline ruptures were now beginning to dry up and only the largest and most aggressive of the
            bunch were able to control one of the now fleeting rupture points, the others were now beginning to flee the area desperately searching for another power source. Unable to 
            find anything, their essence began to destabilize and violent arcs of arcane energy would burst forth at random. Eventually, the creature was barely recognizable and would 
            shrink down to about half of its size before exploding in a burst of arcane energy.</p>
            
            <p>This discovery prompted further experiments now involving unwilling sentient test subjects "volunteered" from nearby prisons but the phenomena could never be recreated with a 
            sentient test subject. Controlled exposure to unstable arcane energy on wildlife yielded similar results to the ones found in the swamp with the ruptured leyline, with higher rates
            of success observed on plantlife and lower rates of success observed in "complex" creatures. </p>
