									<h4 class="mb-20">Passive</h4>
									<p>Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll,
                  even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
                  <p>Aura of Protection: Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw,
                  the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).
                  You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>
                  <p>Aura of Conquest: Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you’re not incapacitated.
                  The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.
                  If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, 
                  and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.</p>
                  <p>Lay on Hands: Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest.
                  With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
                  As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to
                  that creature up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
                  Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it.
                  You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>
                  <p>Multiattack: Bulk makes two melee attacks</p>
                  <p>Great Weapon Master: On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, 
                  you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with,
                  you can choose to take a - 5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack’s damage.</p>
                  <p><i>Axe's Curse</i>: Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk.
                  While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe.
                  If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, 
                  moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target.
                  If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random.
                  You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
                  While going berserk, you are under the effects of rage:
                  • You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>

									<h4 class="mb-20">Actions</h4>
                  <p>Channel Divinity (One time use) Conquering Presence: You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence.
                  As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw.
                  On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute.
                  The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
                  <p>Shield of Faith (1, Bonus Action, Concentration): A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.</p>
									<p>Divine Smite: Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target,
                  in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.
                  The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>
                  <p>Spiritual Weapon (2, Bonus Action, 1 minute): 
                  You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.
                  When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon.
                  On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
                  As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
                  <p>Hold Person (2, action, concentration, 1 minute): Choose a humanoid that you can see within range.
                  The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration.
                  At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw.
                  On a success, the spell ends on the target.</p>
                  <p>Berserker's Axe: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft, 1 target(s). Hit: (1d12 + 4) slashing damage</p>
