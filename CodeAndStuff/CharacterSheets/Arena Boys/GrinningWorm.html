									<h4 class="mb-20">Passive</h4>
									<p>Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll,
                  even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
                  <p>Second Wind: You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm.
                  On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.
                  Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
                  <p>Savage Attacker: Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice and use either total.</p>
                  <p>Skirmisher: Starting at 3rd level, you are difficult to pin down during a fight.
                  You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you.
                  This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
                  <p>Sneak Attack: Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction.
                  Once per turn, you can deal an extra 2d6 (this was supposed to be 3d6) damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.
                  The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
                  You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p> 
                  <p><i>Shadow Clone</i>: The blade creates a shadow clone of the wielder that follows within 5 feet. The shadow is dispelled until the end of the wielder's next turn if attacked and the wielder can choose whether they or the shadow
                  take the damage when targetted by a single target attack. The shadow clone mimics the actions and damage of the wielder.</p>
                  <p>Uncanny Dodge: Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p>
                  <p>List of spells</p>
                  <p>No spells</p>

									<h4 class="mb-20">Actions</h4>
                  <p>Fighting Spirit: Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true.
                  As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on all weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn.
                  When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points.
                  The number of hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.
                  You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
                  <p>Action Surge: Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. 
                  On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.</p>
                  <p>Extra Attack: Attack twice instead of once with the attack action</p>
									<p><i>Collector's Katana (Legendary)</i>: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft, 1 target(s). Hit: (1d10 + 4) slashing damage</p>
