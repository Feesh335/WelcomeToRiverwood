					<p class="sample-text">
						Starting out as a guard in the Dwarven city of Mern Gildur, Arnsgrim quickly rose through the ranks with a reputation for being hard on crime, and harder on those
            who threatened his home city. Although given the option of administering over the city's guard duties, Arnsgrim longed for battle and chose to take over the harshest
            position within the ranks of Mern Gildur: guard captain of the prisoners sent to the Chittering Dark mining operation. The Chittering Dark gained its name for the 
            horrible chittering insects that burrowed throughout it and was considered an unofficial death sentence for those sent to mine the riches that lied within. Those sent
            to the doomed fort of Milboldor quickly learned to band together to survive the chittering onslaught or be consumed in the dark while no one watched. Although many of the criminals sent
            to the dark resented Arnsgrim at first, blaming him for being sent there in the first place, they soon came to revere him almost like a religious figure due to him being
            seen as their only bastion against the insects that haunted their dreams and began to call their band of outcasts the "Sons of Arnsgrim". Arnsgrim took this change of 
            heart in stride and found himself with both a renewed zeal to keep his newfound sons safe and a fanatical hatred of the encroaching insects that could make even the most
            seasoned grudge-bearer blush. Since the arcane incident has occurred, Arnsgrim and crew have been forced to adapt to the rapidly evolving and arcane tainted insects 
            that call the dark home. With no word from Mern Gildur, cave ins and chitterers to the South, and the Collapsin' Bull Wyrm to the North, Arnsgrim and crew have been 
            left with little choice but to stay, pray, and fight like hell.</p>
	    <p> - </p>
            <p>Story Notes: While the party was doing their own thing in Narlan's Priory and the Collection, a few other adventurers sent out by the Ordo Novis found themselves
            stuck in the Chittering Dark and aligned themselves with Arnsgrim to fight for survival. Among them were the twins Anilor the divine soul sorceror and Corlith the 
            ancestral guardian barbarian, Claros the lore master wizard, and Alto the kensei monk. After the chitterers broke into the storage room, a decision was made that it
            was now or never to find an escape, so Arnsgrim, Alto, and a few of the better fighters from amongst the criminals went to take on the wyrm, Anilor and Corlith went 
            to scout out a loud explosion that was heard to the South, and Claros began setting up wards within Milboldor to keep those remaining behind safe and hopefully keep 
            some semblance of order in Arnsgrim's absence.</p>
