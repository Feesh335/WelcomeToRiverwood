									<h1 class="mb-20">The Bound</h1>
                  <p>The Bound are not a proper race, but rather the result of master runesmith Noren'Thal's greatest accomplisment and a pact with the Collector. During the fall
                     of the Nere'Vei empire, Noren'Thal found himself desperately poring over any and every possible source of inspiration for a way to escape the impending doom
                     at the hands of Mundus. This research eventually brought Noren'Thal into contact with a strange whispering stone which offered him the knowledge that he sought
                     for a fair price: his soul. After some negotiations with the stone, as well as the realization that his soul was probably bound for worse places after accidentally
                     killing so many of his apprentices, Noren'Thal agreed to the deal with what he would come to know as the Collector. In exchange for his soul, the Collector would
                     reincarnate him within its realm within the Astral Plane, but he would never be allowed to leave this plane of existence (at least for long). The Collector also taught him the inscription
                     needed to create a runestone known as the soul binding sigil that would allow for others to make the same pact, and soon after the runestones began to be distributed
                     to all. Unsure of whether or not the sigil stone would allow for them to escape in time, mass ritual suicide became quite commonplace so that the Nere'Vei could flee to
                     the Arcane Realm. Due to its introduction so late into the fall of the Nere'Vei empire, the overwhelming majority of Bound are Nere'Vei, but any sentient race that perishes 
                     near a soul binding rune and chooses to live on will be brought back as Bound.</p>

            <p>Your transition to a creature of pure arcane energy brings many changes both detrimental and beneficial.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Ability Score Increase</h4>
									<p>All stats except Strength are increased by 2, but this bonus is lost while below half health. This replaces your previous racial ability score increase.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Age</h4>
									<p>Aging is a thing of the past now, and your form and mental capacity will remain the same for the rest of time</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Alignment</h4>
									<p>The Bound have no alignment, with the person who has become bound retaining thier previous alignment.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Size</h4>
									<p>The bound tend to be between 5 and 6 feet tall regardless of former race, although their form is easily altered especially with enough arcane energy.
                  Size remains medium regardless of this. Bound weigh only about 20 pounds, with an ethereal forcefield giving them the feeling of being heavier than they actually are.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Speed</h4>
									<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet (hover). Hovering grants immunity to fall damage, will not set off floor traps, or take damage from other floor based damage types, but 
                  does not grant immunity to being prone. Hover is lost while prone.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Pure Arcane Being</h4>
									<p>As a creature of pure arcane energy, you must acquire arcane energy to maintain your form. You are only able to heal by being hit with arcane/force energy, entering areas
                  with high concentrations of arcane energy, or siphoning energy from arcane relics. You may not heal yourself with force-dealing self damage. Normal healing spells have no effect. You lose the ability to cast spells while below 25% health.
                  You are completely immune to poison damage and are healed by force damage for the same amount of damage it would normally deal. When at or below 0 health, you become dormant. 
                  While dormant, you are unable to act and will revive once you have acquired enough energy to revive. Your runestone has 3 health and you will die if it is broken.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Return Portal</h4>
									<p>You may teleport to anywhere in the Arcane Realm that you have previously been to at will. You may also select a point in the plane you originated from and can teleport
                  there once per day. Teleporting requires 12 seconds of uninterrupted focus.</p>
