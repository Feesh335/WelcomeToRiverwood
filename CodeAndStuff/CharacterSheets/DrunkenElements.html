					<p class="sample-text">
						Taking inspiration from the Way of the Four Elements and the Way of the Drunken Master, the Way of the Drunken Elements was discovered in an intoxicated revelation as a way to use alcohol to solve all of life's problems in one
            way or another. The Way of the Drunken Elements revolves around crafting elemental brews to enhance the monk's abilities, interfere with the enemy's, and grant elemental powers.

                <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill if you don't already have it.
                Your penchant for sharing your brews tends to make people more likely to open up to you.
                You also gain proficiency with brewer's supplies if you don't already have it.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you learn to craft elemental infused brews. The Way of the Drunken Elements uses brew as a resource. A brewmaster's mini-keg can be used to hold 3 cast's worth of brew while a barrel will hold 10. A container may only carry one brew at a time.
                The monk can brew more through the use of a brewer's kit after 30 minutes of preperation and 3 days of fermenting.
                The base brews can be made with ingredients included in the brewer's kit, but local ingredients can add additional effects to the brew. Effects are halved for imbibers other than the monk.</p>

									<h4 class="mb-20">Wo'Zin Firewine</h4>
									<p>A spiced brew with extremely high alcohol content. Highly flammable. When splashed on enemies, they become flammable and have their chance to hit with all abilities reduced by 2. Can also be used as a reagent to cast breath
                of fire.</p>
                <p>Splash: Target either a 15 foot cone centered on yourself or a 5 foot square within 30 feet. All creatures within range must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency bonus or they will become soaked.
                <p>Breath of Fire: Use your breath as a weapon, each creature in a 15 foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency Bonus.
                A creature takes 2d6+2 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6+3 at 6th level, 4d6+4 at 11th level, and 5d6+5 at 16th level.</p>
                <p>Burning: Whenever you deal fire damage to a flammable creature, that creature catches fire, if it has not already. A creature that has caught fire by this effect will continue to take fire damage equal to your Martial Arts die at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute. The fire can be extinguished through mundane means,
                such as water or a strong wind. A creature or an adjacent ally can also use an action to extinguish the flames affecting it, and creatures that were already on fire due to some other effect are immune to this effect.</p>

							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Deep Earthen Stout</h4>
									<p>An earthy brew that bolsters the imbiber with the strength of the Earth. When consumed, gain resistance to non-magical physical damage for three turns. In addition, the drinker's fists become imbued with 
                  the power of stone, upgrading the unarmed hit die for three turns. Movement speed may not exceed 30 feet while under the effects of the Deep Earthen Stout.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Soju of the Four Winds</h4>
									<p>A smooth brew that imbues the drinker with the speed of the winds. Increases movement speed by 10 feet. After dodging an enemy attack, the monk may move 5 feet in any direction without triggering an opportunity attack. The monk may cast Fist of Unbroken Air as a bonus action instead of an action. This effect lasts one minute.</p>
                  <p>Fist of Unbroken Air: You can create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw.
                  On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone.
                  On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't push it or knock it prone.</p>

							</div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="single-defination">
									<h4 class="mb-20">Summer Sea Spirits</h4>
									<p>A pleasant brew that heals and comforts with a taste remniscent of a calm Summer day by the sea. Grants the drinker 2 charges of Misty Step and surrounds them with Healing Mist for a number of turns equal to half your monk level +1. If splashed on another target, removes any enraged or frightened effects.</p>
                  <p>Healing Mist: You create a mist of magical essence around a target creature that heals the target. The mist can be any color and can have a mystical aura to it such as shimmering, glowing, or electricity (this aura does nothing but add visual effect).
                  The creature then regains 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier hit points.</p>
