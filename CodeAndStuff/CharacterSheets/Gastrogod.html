						A massive snail brought into the Collection now occupying a chunk of a Tarrasque's shell. Originally captured by a team comprised of a young Ogmund,
						a crew of a few dozen, and his then first-mate Morissey, the snail was dubbed "The Gastrogod" after the horrors that the surviving crew
						witnessed. The snail was brought into the Collection and kept finding ways out of its cage, raising hell whenever it had the chance. Eventually,
						it was decided that the snail was more trouble than it was worth when it managed to find and occupy a chunk of tarrasque shell, and was 
						subsequently sealed away into a thrice locked leviathan containment pen, being fed through a small one way portal above its cage.

									<p>Magic Resistance: The Gastrogod has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
                  <p>Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the Gastrogod fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
				  <p>Reflective Carapace: Any time the Gastrogod is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged
				  attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the snail is unaffected. On a 6, the snail is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back
				  at the caster as though it originated from the snail, turning the caster into the target.</p>
				  <p>Siege Monster: The Gastrogod deals double damage to objects and structures</p>

									<h4 class="mb-20">Actions</h4>
                  <p>Multiattack: Gastrogod can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes up to 4 flail attacks, losing one with every 20% health lost.</p>
                  <p>Flail: Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 feet, one target. Hit: (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.</p>
				  <p>Rollout: The Gastrogod rolls 60 feet straight forward, plowing through anything in its way. Anything caught in the path must make DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or
				  take (5d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the snail runs into a wall, it may shake debris loose, causing cave-ins dealing 3d10 to random areas in the room. The snail
				  leaves a trail of slime in its wake, acting as difficult terrain until the next turn.</p>
                  <p>Frightful Presence: Each creature of the Gastrogod's choice that is within 120 feet of the snail and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or
				  become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
				  If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the snail's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p> 
				  <p>Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6): The Gastrogod exhales a spray of noxious acid in a 20 foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw,
				  taking (11d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succesful one.</p>

                  <p>Acid Lob (2): A blob of acid is launched towards a 10 foot radius area of the snail's choosing. A target takes 8d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
				  on a successful one.</p>
				  <p>Flail: Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 feet, one target. Hit: (3d6 + 6) slashing damage.</p>
