					<p class="sample-text">
						Gorloch is a footman serving under the Mollinstead 17th Infantry Company tasked with guarding the relics found by the Ordo Novis, maintaining 
            the peace in the Southern Mollinstead region, and training new recruits at Fort Cainhurst. He faithfully reported to Captain Hemsbrook before the
            incident occurred. Following the incident, many of the Fort's inhabitants died in the blast, while some of the more lucky ones happened to be near
            one of the runestones kept in the fortress and lived again as bound. Gorloch has taken the role of an interim Captain in an attempt to keep some semblance
            of order, but with the seemingly hopeless situation before him, he has become crestfallen as of late. Gorloch isn't quite sure what happened or why so many
            of the soldiers stationed at the fort have become Bound, but he has come to learn that they become weak if they travel too far South, and that the 
            forests to the North have become home to dangerous arc-giants and so he has chosen to focus on rebuilding Fort Cainhurst as a way to keep some semblance
            of normality.

          <p><i>"Huh? Outsiders? Please, forgive our appearance, we mean you no harm, but we lost contact with command a few weeks ago and many of us have perished
          in some sort of blast only to come back as... Some sort of spirits? I'm afraid I can't offer much more information than that, but I've been busy trying to
          maintain order here and haven't had much time for questions beyond that. I'm footman Gorloch, of the Mollinstead 17th Infantry Company and these are my fellow men.
          We've been stuck here since the blast and I'm trying to maintain order, but the giant arcane beasts to the North are preventing us from reaching Meridan's Point so we can
          contact command, and something about this new form is causing us to grow weak if we go too far South. Please, if you have any information regarding the recent events,
          we direly need direction, and I'm not sure that's something I can provide on my own."
