Ah, so the so called "saviors" of Mollinstead have finally arrived. You know, I always figured since I uncovered the
sigil stone that the Ordo Novis would send someone after me to "enact justice". I had a grand speech planned and everything,
figuring I could perhaps show you that what I'm offering would be a blessing compared to the incompetent beuracrats and fanatical
cultists who currently hold the region in a vice grip. Oh, I'm sure they would have fought me regardless, but I would extend the 
olive branch once they realized their futiltiy so we could reign in a new era together.

Oh, what a wonderful dream it was before being so quickly crushed when I stopped by home for some rest after a hard day's work and
see who else but Alanna fucking Crenworth smashing my favorite tea cup accompanied by Ogmund, some mook from the Mollinstead
infantry, and a bunch of nameless adventurers rooting around my house like rats sniffing out treasure. I can almost smell the petty
evils committed in your wake, and frankly, I've grown tired of trying to be the bigger man. I've never been more grateful for the 
power I've uncovered here than now, so that I can truly be the monster you've made me out to be. Ha, no more restraint, no more
incompetent policies and red tape from the Ordo Novis, no more trying to appease the fanatics in the Mundus faithful, no more 
working day in and day out working on the ritual to add Mollinstead to the Collection. All that matters is here and now, so that I
can finally live out my dream of leaving nothing but a trail of ash. Do as you wish, it will not stop me from taking solace in your
flammability. *whistles* Come forth Manos, help me blur the line between my dreams and their nightmares!
