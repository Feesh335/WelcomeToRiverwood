					<p class="sample-text">
						An archmage with the Ordo Novis who has been assigned to the Southern Mollinstead region to oversee the people and conduct research on the numerous ruins within the area.
            Meridan cared little for the people of the region because they rejected the "gift" of arcana and slowly grew disinterested in the Ordo Novis as well, seeing them as "weak and ineffective"
            due to their great restraint which he believed to be holding back progress. A whispering necklace from the Collector eventually drew him to the Nere'Vei ruins where he and his expedition
            party unearthed the sigil stone from ages ago during the Mundus conflict. Tampering with the stone revealed more information from the Collector who ultimately tasked Meridan with sacrificing
            his own associates to prove his loyalty in exchange for being given the secrets of stone. After carrying out this grim task, he activated the orb which began to transport the entire region
            into the collection, causing him to become Bound in the process. He is now focusing his efforts on completing the transportation, in exchange for dominion over the region once it enters the
            Collection.
