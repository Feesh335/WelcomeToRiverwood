					<h3 class="text-heading title_color">Archibald's Notes: Nere'Vei</h3>
					<p class="sample-text">
						The Nere'Vei were a group of forest-dwelling high elves who lived in scattered villages about the forest's edge of Mollinstead. Before the discovery of the arcane, they were considered
            to be weak, with no major defining strengths. All of this changed drastically when the power of the arcane was discovered. Most races found that only a select few of them
            could wield this newfound power, while the Nere'Vei found that their entire race could wield the arcane with ease. Their once powerless race now found themselves in a 
            position of great power as they quickly unravelled the secrets of the arcane. The Nere'Vei quickly went from scattered villages to the most powerful empire that Mollinstead
            had ever known. Great marble cities adorned the landscape as the Nere'Vei wielded their arcane might to unite the land under their rule.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p class="sample-text">This marked the golden age of the Nere'Vei which lasted from 2,250 years ago to 2,000 years ago. During their golden ages, the Nere'Vei founded cities
            ruled by a supreme consul, reporting to the Nere'Vei king in their capital city of Vellis. Their rule started off kind, with the Nere'Vei using their arcane powers to help the
            other races: conjuring food for the poor, creating networks of portals to link nearby cities, and taming the wild with arcane might. As time passed, the other races began to 
            grow complacent with the quality of life gained by working with the Nere'Vei and the Nere'Vei became the ruling class amongst other neighboring civilizations. As time went on,
            a divide began to grow between the Nere'Vei ruling class and the lower class of all other races that inhabited the area. Some tried to rebel but were quickly struck down.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p class="sample-text">
            With the only shot at rebellion quashed and the whole of Mollinstead under their rule, the Nere'Vei would find themselves as the next victim of complacency. Their ease of life 
            and superiority complex caused them to become bored and increasingly depraved. Efforts to improve themselves were replaced with needless decadence and curiosity towards the arcane 
            was replaced with meaningless entertainment held in the city centers. They focused only on their own enjoyment and their cities began to slump while the underclass grew strong
            again by working the earth now that they could no longer rely on the Nere'Vei for help.
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p class="sample-text">
            Again, a rebellion occurred, but this one would not be stamped out so easily like the last time. Folklore in the region tells of a seemingly ordinary man being brought before the
            king to be executed for inciting the rebellion before revealing himself to be Mundus and killing the king and sacking Vellis. Exactly what happened after this is still one of the
            greatest mysteries in the history of Mollinstead. The city of Vellis has been built over the ruins of the ancient elven city of the same name, but most other records of Nere'Vei 
            cities have led to massive craters in the ground. The most popular theory is that the Mundus Faithful destroyed and buried Vellis to make an example of what happens to those who
            oppose them while Mundus simply destroyed the entirety of their other cities, but there are still holes in this theory.

            <p class="sample-text">
            Side-note: Thanks to your assistance with exploring the Nere'Vei Ruins, I have made several incredible discoveries that have shed new light on what we believed about the Nere'Vei!
            The mention of a "sigil stone" being discovered shortly before the calamity occurred leads me to believe that it must be what has caused the Southern Mollinstead region to begin to
            drift through the Astral Plane. The massive crater where the region was closely resembles the craters found where the other Nere'Vei cities to the north should have been and I believe
            that the same event may have occurred there thousands of years ago. I have also had some time to analyze the runestone from that strange sentient golem that you encountered in the ruins.
            While I still can not be sure as to exactly what it is, the rune in the center appears to be of Nere'Vei making, but the symbol is nothing like anything that can be found in the Nere'Vei
            alphabet. Going by the fact that the creature seemed to be made of astral energy, I believe that they may have formed a pact with some form of celestial being to create sentient golems
            to guard their artifacts. There are still some flaws in this theory, and I will discuss this further with my colleagues, but this seems to be the most logical explanation so far.
            </p>
            <p> </p> 
            <p>
            P.S.: I finished translating the runes on the wall, it was a poem about eating... Well, I'll spare you the details, but let's just say that the crude humor is a tell-tale sign of the
            degenerate final era of the Nere'Vei.
            </p>
            <p>
            P.P.S: I will be in Riverwood discussing my findings with some fellow researchers in the Ordo Novis, feel free to stop by and say hello some time.
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Sincerely, Archibald</p>
