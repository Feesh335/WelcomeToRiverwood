						The Ordo Novis was founded 283 years ago in the city of Azor'Thea in the Northern Mollinstead region. Magics originating outside of the Earthly plane (not counting
            divinity) had been outlawed in the Mollinstead region since Mundus had left roughly 1700 years prior. Over time, the taboo of the arcane had begun to fade and people
            sought out the conveniences brought by the arcane. Back alley conjured foods fed the poor during famines and mystic fire scared off the beasts that couldn't be defeated
            with strength alone. As the use of the arcane became more and more common, it eventually became a matter of public contention with those still faithful to Mundus wishing
            to see to it that the history of the Nere'Vei did not repeat itself. As such, the Ordo Novis was born as a government body to regulate the usage of the arcane to ensure
            that the mystic forces were used for the betterment of society rather than to subjugate it. Colleges were founded to study the arcane and towns sprang up around them
            to benefit from the magical gifts that so often accompanied them and the people prospered. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p class="sample-text">Over the last 283 years, the Ordo Novis has continued to grow in popularity
            and for the most part has made good on its promises. As such, fewer people in the Mollinstead have remained with the Mundus Faithful, instead choosing the conveniences 
            offered by the Ordo Novis until we reach today, where only the Southern Mollinstead region has a faithful majority. However, not all within the Ordo Novis truly serve 
            the people, as with any government body given power, those who seek power only for themselves have begun to climb their ranks. One such example is archmage Meridan Seelie,
            who does the bare minimum to hold his position and spends his spare time seeking power for himself, choosing to govern over the Southern Mollinstead region to hoard relics
            from the Nere'Vei ruins for himself. Archmage Morthil Featherlight serves as the leader of the order and is doing what he can to maintain order, but knows that the game of
            politics is a delicate one and struggles to find a balance between furthering the Ordo Novis and appeasing the territories it governs over. Only time will tell which way 
            the balance of power will tip.</p>
