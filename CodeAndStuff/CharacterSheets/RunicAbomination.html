					<p class="sample-text">
						This horrifying amalgamation is the result of a bag of Bound runestones trying to bind the same few souls, warping them beyond recognition in the process. The resulting
            abomination is no longer capable of thought beyond its base instincts and lashes out at everything in a fit of psychic agony. Its form shifts about constantly, but it remains
            roughly 10 feet tall and strikes out with its warped tentacle like limbs.
					</p>
          <p><i>"Ah, you must be talking about that... Thing. I'm a trained soldier, and staving off my fears to stay in the fight is second nature, but no amount of training could have prepared
          me for... That. The way it slinks around with the grace of a dancer despite having the form of an ogre, or the way it calmly stays in the corner murmuring before it suddenly begins wailing
          and thrashing about, it all just sets my nerves ablaze. But I could just ignore all of it, chalking it up as some unknowable horror that emerged from one of the artifacts after the blast,
          if it weren't for the way it seems to sound like my old friend Wilhelm who was on guard duty down there during the blast. We all like to try to forget about it. If you get close to the
          stairs leading to the vault you can hear its warped screaming in your head, and so we all give it wide berth. Whatever business you have down there, I will have no part in it. For that matter,
           forget that I ever brought it up. If I were still human, I don't know that I'd ever be able to sleep again." -Footman Gorloch</i></p>
