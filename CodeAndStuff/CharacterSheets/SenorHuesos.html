						In life, Señor Huesos was a bard fascinated with the dead and believed that they didn't deserve the somber dirges that people had grown so accustomed to playing to
            mourn them, and instead learned lively songs so catchy that even the dead danced along. As time went on and Huesos's renown increased, eventually death itself heard
            tales of this legendary bard who played for the dead. Fascinated by him, death offered a challenge: make me dance to your tune and I'll grant you a wish. Huesos spent
            the rest of his lifetime in pursuit of a song to regale death. Years passed to no avail, and Huesos found himself on his deathbed, he offered his hand for one last dance
            and was overjoyed when death took it. Expecting the usual wish of riches, immortality, or favors for some loved ones, death was surprised when Huesos wished to retain
            sentience as a skeleton but happily obliged. Even now, the dead wander towards Huesos and his songs, and he's been hired by the collector to attract some of the more 
            interesting dead to the Collection.
