						An Eldritch abomination formed by the collective greed of the mortal races which has been weaponized by the Collector for clearing out any "problematic" additions to
            the collection. It has come to be known as Avarice due its compulsion to harvest everyone and everything on the land it is unleashed upon before it is caged away again
            for the next harvest.

									<p>Immutable Form: Avarice is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</p>
                  <p>Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Avarice fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
                  <p>Siege Monster. Avarice deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
                  <p>Regeneration: Avarice regains 3d10 hp when killing a target</p>
                  <p>Maddening Presence: All creatures with 30 feet of Avarice take 1d20 sanity loss when its turn begins. Any damage dealt by Avarice also deals 5X
                  that amount to a creature's sanity. A creature starts with 100 sanity, and takes on short term madness when this is reduced to 0, regaining it 1 hour after 
                  they have last seen Avarice.</p>
                  <p>Madness: 01-20	Character faints (can be awakened by vigorous action taking 1 round; thereafter, character is shaken until duration expires).
21-30	Character has a screaming fit.
31-40	Character flees in panic.
41-50	Character shows physical hysterics or emotional outburst (laughing, crying, and so on).
51-55	Character babbles in incoherent rapid speech or in logorrhea (a torrent of coherent speech).
56-60	Character gripped by intense phobia, perhaps rooting her to the spot.
61-65	Character becomes homicidal, dealing harm to nearest person as efficiently as possible.
66-70	Character has hallucinations or delusions (details at the discretion of the GM).
71-75	Character gripped with echopraxia or echolalia (saying or doing whatever those nearby say or do).
76-80	Character gripped with strange or deviant eating desire (dirt, slime, cannibalism, and so on).
81-90	Character falls into a stupor (assumes fetal position, oblivious to events around her).
91-99	Character becomes catatonic (can stand but has no will or interest; may be led or forced to simple actions but takes no independent action).
100	Character gains insight into Avarice's status.</p>

                  <p>Lashing Tentacle: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: (1d6+1) piercing damage plus (1d6+1) psychic damage.</p>

									<h4 class="mb-20">Legendary Actions</h4>
                  <p>Avarice can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Avarice regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
									<p>Gnashing of Teeth: (Costs 1 action): Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) acid damage.</p>
                  <p>Collector's Grasp: (Costs 2 Actions): Avarice causes the ground in a 20-foot square that it can see within 90 feet of it to turn into teeth and maws
                  until the start of its next turn. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. Any creature takes (2d6) piercing damage for each 5 feet it moves 
                  on this terrain.</p>
                  <p>Call of the Void: Each creature within 30 feet of Avarice must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take (4d12) psychic damage.</p>
