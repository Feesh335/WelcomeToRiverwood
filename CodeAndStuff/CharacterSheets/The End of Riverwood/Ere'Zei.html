						The founding member of the Golden Circle and the most loyal of the members to the will of the Collector. The gregarious minds he has consumed himself and fed to the
            Collector have warped his own thoughts, making him markedly more sociable than most mind flayers. He has come to delight in goading his opponents into making mistakes
            as well as irritating his less faithful colleagues over their own mistakes. He is most often tasked with finishing missions in which there is little tolerance for 
            in-fighting and insubordination among the other members of the Golden Circle. </p>
