					<p class="sample-text">
						Known to many as the Magic Breaker, Mundus is the patron god of the appropriately named Mundus Faithful. Championing the causes of the downtrodden by drawing out
            their inner strength and teaching them to reject the influences of the outside realms, Mundus is anathema to all things magical, for better or worse. In truly dire
            situations, a powerful follower of Mundus making a tremendous sacrifice - an arcane relic of unfathomable power or their very life - may allow for Mundus to send
            aid to the world in the form of a divine aspect, a physical manifestation of his earthly form, carrying his memories, will, and a significant portion of his strength.
            Eras have sometimes gone by without Mundus sending forth his aspect to carry out his will, but it is always brought forth for the same reason: to turn back the damage
            inflicted by those who dabble in the arcane, a task that none have succeeded in seeing that it is not carried out.

                  <p>Legendary Resistance (5/Day). If the Aspect of Mundus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
                  <p>Magic Breaker: On being hit by Mundus, have Mundus and the target roll a D20. Subtract the target's D20 + their proficiency bonus from Mundus's D20
                  and deplete all spell slots of that level and lower. An antimagic zone with a radius of 10 feet is always present surrounding the Avatar of Mundus.</p>
                  <p>Divine Presense: Each creature of Mundus's choice within 120 feet of him must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
                  This roll is repeated at the end of each creature's turn until this effect is dispelled.</p>
