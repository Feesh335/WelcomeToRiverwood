						<s>Epstein</s> Noren'Thal didn't kill himself. Well, sort of... He used create Clone and hid the clone in the Collection before using the runeblade to kill himself,
            transferred his soul to the clone without being Bound anymore, and then used Gorloch's runestone as a powersource/disguise for his suit. This is a different suit built
            for a humanoid occupant, but made to look the same to avoid arousing any suspicion.
