The sigil stone is in the process of binding Southern Mollinstead to the Collection. 
Noren'Thal is the only one who knows how to reverse this effect without nullifying the sigil stone.
The Mundus Faithful wants to disenchant the stone to return the continent and prevent further abuse of the stone
	- Narlan secretly wants to wait until the region is in the Collection so it can be used to allow Mundus to reincarnate
	  and finish off the Nere'Vei.
Noren'Thal would prefer that the region does not merge with the Collection, but is more concerned with obtaining the stone to find
a way to break the Collector's grasp on the Nere'Vei. He is more concerned still with the ritual being completed and Mundus coming 
back.
Alanna was secretly carrying a divine spark which restored Mundus in his own realm. He had begun to fade as the world needed him 
less and there were fewer followers. Completing the ritual with the sigil stone will cause him to become incarnate in the physical
world again. She is weaker due to the spark not returning when she was ressurrected.
The Golden Circle has turned the Mollinstead into a chance to clash with and one up each other. Mostly Ogmund and Ere'Zei going
back and forth. 
The Circle wants for Mollinstead to join with the collection. 
	-Ere'Zei thinks the continent is too troublesome and plans on using Avarice to kill off all sentient life on it. 
	-Ogmund just wants to be rid of any troublesome individuals so he can rule it by proxy and gain from it. 
The protective barrier near Riverwood will be dispersed if the region returns. There will still be some time before the ritual is 
completed and Mundus is summoned. 
If Cervadeus is allowed full access to the stone, it will overload him and nuke the area. 
Hanible is Noren'Thal's nephew
