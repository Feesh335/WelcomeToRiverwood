					<h3 class="text-heading title_color">Alanna Crenworth, "The Priestess"</h3>
					<p class="sample-text">
						Daughter of the mayor of Riverwood and high priestess of the Mundus Faithful. From a young age she had a rebellious streak and a strong interest in the Mundus Faithful.
            Her father allowed her to go off to Narlan's Priory to be trained as a priestess of the Mundus Faithful. Father Narlan quickly took interest in her once she demonstrated
            her natural talent in the ways of the faith and took her in as an apprentice where she quickly rose through the ranks. The times were quiet and peaceful and Alanna became
            a close friend with Sister Abernathy, the only priestess she truly trusted. Once the Ordo Novis arrived in Southern Mollinstead, she quickly grew to hate them and frequently 
            found herself in debates with her father, who felt little choice but to work with the Ordo Novis due to their power and influence. Rather than working with them diplomatically,
            Alanna set out to spy on the Ordo Novis to prove that they did not have the region's interests in mind and set out to gather dirt on Meridan Seelie, who made little effort
            to hide his true intentions. Her big break came when Meridan brought the sigil stone back to his tower and began bragging to his assistants about what he would do once he mastered 
            the power contained within it, but before she could head back to Riverwood, she was caught in the blastwave of the sigil's activation. Although her body was utterly destroyed,
            her soul found its way into a binding rune that Meridan had kept on a shelf in his tower and found herself waking up as a Bound. Although disgusted with her new form which
            went against everything she believed in, she found her true purpose in the wake of the tragedy: to rally the Mundus Faithful and bring a permanent end to the defilers. She
            crafted a new robe and donned a mask to hide her new form and set out to the Arcane Realm to stop Meridan, occasionally stopping by Narlan's priory to talk with Sister Abernathy.

									<h4 class="mb-20">Passive</h4>
									<p>Rage: In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>
                  <p>Zealot: The first hit landed each round deals an extra 1d6 + 1 radiant damage.</p>
                  <p>Danger Sense: At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. 
                  You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. 
                  To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>
                  <p>Vessel of Mundus: Alanna has felt that something has been amiss since she was ressurrected and feels compelled to perform the ritual of Mundus</p>

									<h4 class="mb-20">Actions</h4>
									<p>Gavel of the Faithful: Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft, 1 target. Hit: (3d6+6 bludgeoning + 1 radiant) damage. 
                  This attack ignores any magical effects such as blur or mage armor and automatically interrupts concentration spells if the target is using one.</p>
                  <p>Spellcasting. The drow is a 20th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). The drow has the following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, mending, resistance, sacred flame, thaumaturgy

1st level (4 slots): bane, command, cure wounds, guiding bolt

2nd level (3 slots): hold person, silence, spiritual weapon

3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, clairvoyance, dispel magic, spirit guardians

4th level (3 slots): banishment, death ward, freedom of movement, guardian of faith

5th level (3 slots): contagion, flame strike, geas, mass cure wounds

6th level (2 slots): blade barrier, harm

7th level (2 slots): divine word, fire storm</p>
                <p>(2 uses) Channel Divinity: Blessing of Mundus: At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature 
                a +5 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. If the attack lands, any attempt to maintain concentration is made with disadvantage. 
                You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>
