						A silver tongued thief with a nose for treasure and a heart of coal. Took off with the priory's emergency relic and is hoping to loot Fort Cainhurst so he can sell the relics
            to the needy of Riverwood to make a fortune. 
					</p>
          <p><i>"Look, I'm going to save us both some time and just say this - you don't like me, and I don't like you. The only people tough enough to make it this far north and 
          live to talk about it are unrepenant assholes who aren't afraid to gamble with their lives and unrepenant assholes who aren't afraid to gamble with their lives but have 
          the kind of charisma it takes to convince you that that isn't an accurate description of them. I'm the former, and you look to me like the latter. But let's set that aside for a moment to talk about
          a certain missing and hopefully dead archmage who fits that second category who stole my wedding ring to "study the arcane properties within" before locking it up in the 
          vault under this keep. Now I'm hardly the sentimental type, but I'll be damned if I'm letting that mage have the last laugh at my expense and walk out of this situation 
          with blue balls and empty pockets. So here's the deal, there's some sort of god forsaken nightmare behind those doors as well as a small mountain of valuables next to it. 
          I can't take that thing alone, and I don't want to find out the hard way that I can't just snatch the treasure and run, so we're going to go in there together, 
          kill that thing, and I'll even let you keep your fair share of the loot, capiche? You can call me Tim. People usually call me Tim the Scoundrel, but there haven't been enough
          people here for me to wind up with that nickname again, at least not yet.</p></i>
